@article{Citrin2018,
abstract = {This article reviews recent survey-based research on citizens' trust in government, focusing particularly on the United States. It addresses the long-term decline in trust and potential causes for this decline, with an emphasis on the effects of partisanship, polarization, performance, process, and media priming. While dispositions can anchor trust levels, the dominant research findings show that the sources of variation and change in trust are political, if multifaceted, in nature. We discuss new versions of standard measures, call for a renewed look at the distinction between trust in authorities and trust in the regime, review ongoing work on how and why trust matters, and recommend broadening the foci of mistrust to include antiestablishment sentiments and attacks on electoral integrity. How trust intervenes between perceptions of political processes and compliance with authoritative commands is a critical domain for additional research. We conclude with a caveat against confidence that the decline in trust can be quickly or easily reversed.},

Policy - the downsides of party clarity. if the parties were essentially the same in the past, then most people probably felt like their party represented them. as the parties have polarized, voters learn the ways in which they are the same as their party, but they also learn the ways in which they are different.

@article{House1975,
abstract = {During the 1970s the U.S. has witnessed the emergence of a wide range of organizations that explicitly reject the norms of rational-bureaucracy and identify themselves as "alternative institutions" or "collectives." Grounded in an extensive study of the practices of worker collectives, this paper seeks to identify some of the structural commonalities which link these new work organizations and to develop a theoretical framework for understanding them. First, the ideal-type features of collectivist democracy are delineated and contrasted with the characteristic features of bureaucracy. The ideal-type approach allows us to assess these organizations not as failures to achieve bureaucratic standards they do not share, but as efforts to realize wholly different values. Second, constraints and social costs that inhibit the realization of organizational democracy are discussed. It is in the conceptualization of alternative forms of organization that organizational theory has been weakest, and it is here that the experimentation of collectives may broaden our understanding.},

The parties are polarized along a traditional cleavage, but they are also internally divided along a second issue dimension. We introduce a threat of entry from Outsider candidates, who have the prominence and resources to bypass party elites. We consider when voters will turn to Outsiders, and identify the conditions under which Outsiders will enter the election through an established party's nomination process, as opposed to circumventing established parties via a third-party challenge. We further explore when the elites will fail to respond to the threat of Outsider candidates. Our framework highlights how established parties will be especially vulnerable to Outsider primary entry in periods of intense ideological polarization between the parties, and that this vulnerability is especially heightened for the majority party.},

abstract = {Health economic evaluations involve synthesising information across different sources to evaluate the costs and consequences of a number of health care interventions with the aim of deciding on the “optimal” intervention. Health economic decisions are typi- cally subject to parametric uncertainty. Thus, practitioners are encouraged to investigate how this uncertainty affects the decision-making process. Value of Information measures evaluate the economic cost of parametric uncertainty and can determine whether future research is required to reduce parametric uncertainty. In addition to this, they can priori- tise research questions and design data collection exercises. Broadly, computational issues have hindered their widespread implementation but recent methodological developments have significantly reduced the computation time required. In this paper, software devel- oped to implement these Value of Information computation methods in R is presented. This will continue to lower the barrier to the implementation of Value of Information methods in practice. This paper focusses on two R packages, BCEA and EVSI. These packages can be used to calculate different Value of Information measures are used at different points in the research design cycle. Additionally, BCEA and EVSI provide stan- dardised graphics for the presentation of Value of Information analysis to increase their applicability in decision-making and research design in health economic evaluations.

abstract = {Politics and political conflict often occur in the written and spoken word. Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods-they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Political Methodology.

  abstract = {National survey data demonstrate that support of the federal government decreased substantially between 1964 and 1970. Policy preference, a lack of perceived difference between the parties, and policy dissatisfaction were hypothesized as correlates of trust and alternative explanations of this decrease. Analysis revealed that the increased distrust in government, or cynicism, was associated with reactions to the issues of racial integration and U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war. A curvilinear relationship was found between policy preference on these and other contemporary social issues and political cynicism. The minority favoring centrist policies was more likely to trust the government than the large proportion who preferred noncentrist policy alternatives. This complex relationship between trust and policy preference is explained by dissatisfaction with the policies of both political parties. The dissatisfied noncentrists formed highly polarized and distinct types: “cynics of the left,” who preferred policies providing social change, and “cynics of the right,” who favored policies of social control.},

The analysis of the concept of "the meaning of life" is a twofold task; "the meaning" and "life" both need to be examined. In this paper, I primarily focus on "the meaning." I argue that, although there is much disagreement and confusion in the literature about the meaning of "the meaning" as it is applied to life, there is one most plausible interpretation of this notion. In the end, even though I do not answer the question of the meaning of life, I propose an account of what a correct answer to the question is supposed to look like, based on my original function analysis of "the meaning".},

I argue that compared to most other democracies, the US system offers much less opportunity for organized populist parties but more opportunity for populist candidacies. Today's major parties may also be more vulnerable to populist insurgency than at other points in US history because of (1) changes in communications technology, (2) the unpopularity of mainstream parties and party leaders, and (3) representation gaps created by an increasingly racialized party system. Although no democratic system is immune to deterioration, the US constitutional system impedes authoritarian populism, just as it obstructs party power generally. But the vulnerability of the major parties to populist insurgency poses a threat to liberal democratic norms in the United States, just as it does elsewhere.},

Methods. Using data from the 1997 Tom{\'{a}}s Rivera Policy Institute post-election survey carried out in California and Texas, supplemented with data on the ethnicity of legislators serving each respondent, we test this political empowerment thesis. Results. The presence of Latino representatives in the state assembly, state senate, and/or U.S. House is associated with lower levels of political alienation among Latino constituents. The effect is modest, and we find that other factors - demographic, political, and ethnic-specific - also exert powerful influences on levels of political alienation among Latinos. Conclusions. Although finding modest evidence for the political empowerment thesis, descriptive representation alone is not a panacea for creating politically engaged personas among Latinos.},

Marijuana users are differentiated from non-users in their more negative views toward the most proximate authority structures and their desire for changes in laws regulating behaviors commonly associated with youth. Marijuana use was not associated with broader social concerns or political ideology, and was only tenuously associated with political alienation.
